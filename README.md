# SentiSync

SentiSync is a real-time mood and energy tracker that helps you align your day with your natural rhythms. Designed as a mobile-first, intuitive companion, SentiSync lets you log how you feel in the flow of your day — no emoji scales, no friction.

## 🚀 Why SentiSync?

Most mood trackers rely on simplified inputs (like smiley faces) that don’t reflect the complexity of how we actually feel. SentiSync was built for people who want more than a check-in — they want insights.

SentiSync helps you:
- Track mood and energy levels through an interactive, gesture-based graph
- Get AI-generated suggestions to improve your structure and flow
- Forecast future dips or peaks based on your patterns
- Feel more in control of your day — and in sync with yourself

  Bolt AI generates micro-suggestions based on:
  - Recent mood/energy logs
  - Time of day
  - Summary of personal patterns
